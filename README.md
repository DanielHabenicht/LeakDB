# LeakDB
LeakDB (Leakage Diagnosis Benchmark) is a realistic leakage dataset for water distribution networks.
The dataset is comprised of a large number of artificially created but realistic leakage scenarios, on different water distribution networks, under varying conditions. 
A scoring algorithm in MATLAB code is provided to evaluate the results of different algorithms.
